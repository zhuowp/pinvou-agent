# CodeWhale Fork Modification Register

> Updated: 2026-09-04. Public maintenance baseline: upstream `v0.9.5` r13, published through CodeWhale PR #32; an exact, unpublished r14 candidate adds Shell task-origin reconciliation. Canonical Chinese register: [`docs/fork-modifications.md`](fork-modifications.md). This English page is a condensed summary; the Chinese version is the complete, authoritative register.
>
> 2026-08-22 corrections: (1) the parent gitlink bump from r6 (`3bbf8421`) to r7 happened in parent PR #285 (`95502ac8`), not in PR #302 — PR #302 started from a pre-#285 main and merged without touching the gitlink; PR #305 later advanced the published baseline to r8. (2) PR #302 (capability-bundle unification, parent commit `c75f2fb2`) updated the parent-side scope model — the single `disabled_bundles.json` (package id × mode, plus `hidden_scopes`) replaced the separate `disabled_connectors.json` / `disabled_skills.json` files.

## Current baseline

### r12 provider-native search and keyless Bing tail (engine side merged)

- CodeWhale PR #33 (six commits merged at `4f612e548`): adds provider-native search adapters for DeepSeek Responses, Model Studio Token Plan (Qwen), Moonshot/Kimi (K2.6 builtin `$web_search`, K3 official Formula protocol, Kimi Code `/search`), Z.AI/Zhipu (global `search-prime` / China `search_std`), and Xiaomi MiMo. Capability gating is exact to provider+model+official endpoint+product surface and fails closed; K3 Formula gets a dedicated 180-second budget and an 8-call limit. The reviewer-found loose endpoint matching (whole-URL lowercasing, unlimited trailing slashes) was tightened in the closing commit `4f612e548` via `is_exact_url_route`. Fingerprint anchors: `documented_server_side_web_search_for_route`, `WEB_SEARCH_FORMULA_URI`.
- CodeWhale PR #35 (merged at `9c5f4f19`): the keyless chain tail after API-backed providers switches from DuckDuckGo to Bing (live measurements show DDG is DNS-poisoned and SNI-reset in mainland China while Bing serves both global and China endpoints keyless); the all-backends-down error now suggests API-backed `[search]` providers; adds `forkguard_api_provider_chain_tail_is_bing` (forkguard total 56→57).
- r12 parent-side integration (PR #375): gitlink → `9c5f4f19`, settings-page search-source guidance copy (i18n zh/en/ja), and comment corrections in `prefs/search.rs` plus the matching `bridge.rs` injection-site comment and test docstring (the engine default is still DuckDuckGo; the app-side default Bing comes from the bridge's explicit `EngineConfig` injection).

### r14 candidate Shell task-origin reconciliation (unpublished)

- The engine stamps Shell work with its originating tool call and turn. Job snapshots and completion events expose those stable identities, allowing hosts to reconcile updates at the original transcript position instead of guessing from command text. The Pinvou bridge preserves a safe legacy fallback, keeps unmatched running jobs visible after compaction or reload, and prevents identified completed root jobs from being appended at the current timeline tail when their origin card is no longer loaded.
- Candidate guards: `forkguard_background_shell_job_preserves_origin_identity` covers identity on snapshots and completion events, while `forkguard_tool_context_for_call_preserves_turn_and_sets_call_origin` covers the engine dispatch stamp. Parent coverage includes `forkguard_shell_monitor_assigns_identical_commands_by_stable_origin` and `shell_task_projection.test.mjs`.

### r11 provider, MCP, steer, and platform boundaries (published)

- CodeWhale PRs #18, #21, #22, #25, #26, #27, #29, and #30 are published at `0d89a31be016457c180501417dd2c0f34ce844a6`. Strict-direct providers accept a wire-model casing difference only when exactly one owned model row proves the match; the parent adds a GLM bridge regression from a lowercase saved value to canonical `GLM-5.2`.
- Explicit route output ceilings now constrain request budgets; the host declares an output route fact for operator-owned uncatalogued models on custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints while official and coding-plan endpoints stay fail-closed (parent PR #216). Moonshot omits only incompatible tools, emits one user-visible diagnostic per turn, and rejects a named `tool_choice` when its target was omitted. Host MCP secret resolution avoids process-environment writes, while denied servers disappear consistently from the pool, catalog, direct calls, reloads, and subagent inheritance.
- `withdraw_steer` returns `SteerWithdrawal` to distinguish withdrawn, committed, and missing input. Windows Shell output uses incremental UTF-8 decoding across polls, and dependency updates address the h2/lru advisories. r11 adds 15 `forkguard_*` regressions, raising the total from 41 to 56 without creating a new long-lived topic.
- r11 adds 48 files and `+2242/-292` over r10. Provider projection, host MCP policy, steer lifecycle, and cross-platform Shell decoding remain generic upstream candidates.

### r11 steer withdrawal outcome (published)

- CodeWhale PR #30 landed as `e6bc34769` (maintainer follow-up `69ed3bfbd` sharpens the contract and brings the tests under the forkguard filter): `EngineHandle::withdraw_steer` now returns `SteerWithdrawal::Retired` (withdrawn, never to be injected, exactly one `SteerDropped`) or `NotPending` (already settled or unknown — **not proof of delivery**; hosts must reconcile the terminal event and preserve an indeterminate input rather than reporting success). pinvou-agent#308’s interrupt-and-send uses the outcome to decide whether re-sending is safe, closing the duplicate-delivery race. A `#[must_use]` marker prevents hosts from silently ignoring the outcome.
- The same window also landed an MCP disabled-tool bypass closure (`e68a185c2`) and strict direct-model case matching (`0d89a31be`); both stay inside existing topics.

### r10 fixed-sampling and compaction-usage boundaries (published)

- CodeWhale PR #19 was published as `feb8761aeda31749f3d54c6e1f8ef460540567a1`. The Kimi Code membership route strips non-default sampling only for the exact membership roster (`k3`, `k3-256k`, `kimi-for-coding`, and `kimi-for-coding-highspeed`). DeepSeek keeps a compatibility shim only for exact `deepseek-v4-flash` Responses calls, while the Chat dialect preserves the documented 0..=2 sampling contract.
- K3 and K3-256K reuse the existing membership route, reasoning dialect, and model metadata paths. `k3-256k` is fixed at 262,144 context tokens so the generic name hint cannot reinterpret it as 256,000; bare `k3` alone retains the existing 1M entitlement path.
- `CompactionCompleted.post_input_tokens` uses the engine's canonical estimate for the complete compacted request, including the system prompt and merged summary. The parent updates the usage chip immediately and persists a non-turn `context_snapshot`, so remounting does not restore the pre-compaction value.
- r10 adds 17 files and `+370/-31` over r9, including four new `forkguard_*` regressions. The change stays within the existing T1 routing and host-event boundary and adds no long-lived fork topic.

### r9 conversation insertion and edit boundaries (published)

- CodeWhale PR #16 was published as `8aa5f77d35ac1d00d1f444193543307a7e9b391c`. Steer now returns an opaque id, reports `SteerCommitted` / `SteerDropped`, preserves or retires uncommitted input according to the explicit cancel mode, and deterministically terminates foreground Shell work owned by the cancelled turn.
- CodeWhale PR #17 was published as `07d183e350ce4a1ed4f91bdfa1875c996e710d2b`. `EditLastTurnTarget` distinguishes editable text, unsupported latest user content, and a missing target. Tool results, internal runtime envelopes, and non-authoritative provenance cannot become edit points; genuine unsupported latest user content also cannot be skipped in favor of older text.
- Edit preflight rejection uses stable nonrecoverable `edit_last_turn_*` codes and one authoritative `TurnComplete(Failed)`. The parent suppresses optimistic fallback persistence and uses `chat:done.operation_rejected` to hydrate the unchanged durable transcript in both Tauri and Web clients.
- r9 adds 18 files and `+1998/-178` over r8. The retained volume is the concurrency/state coverage for cross-interrupt steer ownership, Shell termination, and provenance-aware history classification; these invariants belong in the Engine lifecycle and are prioritized for upstreaming as generic host APIs.

### r8 per-turn evaluation security extension (published)

CodeWhale PR #15 combined candidate `1eca6103a` with security follow-ups `169c24cc5`, `21e5f661a`, and `a647ed866`, then squash-merged them as `d127aed113529dc93754d044b9f352e9746f6b83`. The merge commit has the same tree as the verified candidate head and is published as immutable tag `pinvou-v0.9.5-r8`. It adds a process-local per-turn tool policy, complete trusted-path replacement, an exact final dispatch gate, read-only `File` action schema projection with a repeated read-only check before final execution, and denial of queued goal continuation, edit replay, and MCP reload while restricted. Restricted turns also block queued control-plane operations, hooks, MCP initialization, dynamic tools, and child agents. After a restricted turn, idle child-agent completion and background-Shell wake remain deferred until an explicit message installs replacement authority; read-only `Bash` uses the hardened `ShellPolicy::ReadOnly` direct-argv path. Tool logs and audits retain only non-private identity fields. At r8 publication, the parent gitlink and verifier aligned strictly to that immutable tag; the Current baseline section above is authoritative for the active public baseline.

### r13 GAIA benchmark isolation extension (published)

- CodeWhale PR #32 was squash-merged as `f853f8f1566c57e6be40d5439a222a932aa79ef5`, directly on r12, and published as immutable tag `pinvou-v0.9.5-r13`.
- Two empty, default-off features, `benchmark-observability` and `benchmark-eval-controls`, contain request/TTFT metrics, the post-budget final-only fuse, and deterministic repair of unambiguous read-only calls. The parent enables them only through `benchmark-hooks`.
- Desktop keeps `local-embed` as its default feature and does not compile these paths. The default build passes independently. r13 contains no wildcard proxy trust, IPv6 fake-IP exception, or other global network-policy change.
- Six `forkguard_benchmark_*` behavior tests and exact published fingerprints protect the boundary. The parent fork guard always runs these feature-gated tests for r13 and no longer carries an unpublished-candidate exception.

### Published session fix

- v0.9.5 `load_session` treats an unmatched `tool_use` as evidence of a crashed process. That assumption is invalid when Pinvou persists a live tool call and reads the same session again during the turn.
- The engine fix was merged through `Pinvou/CodeWhale#11`; its public commit is `2eceab4e19cb0b15576c09d5b89e0d8bc42e11fd`.
- T1 now separates side-effect-free `load_session_snapshot` from explicit `recover_session_for_resume`. Pinvou uses snapshots for all runtime read-modify-write paths and performs durable recovery only during app process startup, before any Engine can own a session.
- Revision reconciliation remains fail-closed only for genuine cross-client turns. A local `chat:done` immediately releases the next send, readback failures cannot block ordinary local chat, and cross-client pending notices are deduplicated per session.
- Two CodeWhale tests, two parent `forkguard_*` tests, and Tauri/Web frontend behavior coverage protect side-effect-free runtime reads, observable and idempotent explicit recovery, safe secondary Store opening, durable startup recovery, and consecutive sends after local completion.
- The fix is included in the published head, drift figures, and immutable tag `pinvou-v0.9.5-r5`; CodeWhale required checks and parent automation pass.

### Session steer and deterministic cancel (CodeWhale#16 / pinvou-agent#308, published)

- **Status**: CodeWhale#16 is merged and `#30` (`withdraw_steer` returning the `SteerWithdrawal` outcome) landed as a follow-up; the public baseline is `pinvou-v0.9.5-r11` (`0d89a31be`). Per this section's own convention its content has folded into the T1/T2 topic registers, the public baseline head, and the drift figures above; the section remains as the release record.
- **T1 (host embedding and routing boundary) additions**:
  - Session steer (mid-turn injection) primitives: `SteerMessage { id, content }` travels the steer channel; `EngineHandle::steer` assigns and returns an opaque `steer_id` at enqueue time; `Event::SteerCommitted` / `Event::SteerDropped` carry `steer_id` so the host can correlate its queued placeholder message — no content hash (a cross-language hash over non-ASCII content cannot be made consistent).
  - `EngineHandle::cancel_with_mode(reason, CancelMode)` (since r10): `InterruptKeepInbox` (⚡ interrupt) parks unconsumed steers for the next turn's step boundary; `StopDropInbox` (⏹ stop) settles at every Interrupted exit — both `pending_steers` and steer-channel residue emit one `SteerDropped` each. The disposition mode and the cancel token are published atomically by one handle call; there is no separate host-side switch set before cancel.
  - `Op::SyncSession` and `Op::Shutdown` drain queued steers with per-message `SteerDropped` events, preventing cross-session injection; `Drop for Engine` is a best-effort `try_send` backstop for host evict/reclaim paths that drop the engine directly.
  - Steer withdrawal: `EngineHandle::withdraw_steer` records the id in a shared withdrawn set and returns a `SteerWithdrawal` outcome since #30 (`Retired` = will never inject, resend-safe; `NotPending` = no proof of delivery, reconcile; see the status note above — the original r10 API was fire-and-forget); every collection/injection point filters withdrawn ids and emits exactly one `SteerDropped`, so a withdrawn steer is never injected into the transcript. Marks survive across turns and are cleared on `SyncSession`/`Shutdown`. This makes the host UI's queued-placeholder ✕ effective until the moment of injection.
- **T2 (tool compatibility and command-execution safety) addition**:
  - Cancel-time process kills are scoped: `ShellManager::kill_running_turn_foreground` kills only this turn's foreground (`spawned_as_foreground`, no `owner_agent`) shell process groups — within the foundation, user-backgrounded tasks and sub-agent background shells are not killed by cancel. Scope note: this describes the foundation's `ShellManager` only; the Pinvou app layer separately runs its own turn-scoped cleanup on cancel (`SessionTurnShellTasks`), which still reaps the interrupted turn's registered background tasks and owned sub-agent shells.
- **Guards**: eight new behavior tests — `steer_lifecycle_rejects_idle_and_assigns_unique_ids`, `steer_lifecycle_capacity_wait_revalidates_target`, `steer_lifecycle_interrupt_keeps_input_for_next_turn`, `steer_lifecycle_stop_retires_reserved_late_send_once`, `steer_lifecycle_session_rejects_late_reserved_send`, `forkguard_steer_lifecycle_withdrawal_is_bounded_and_prevents_commit`, `engine_drop_reports_unconsumed_steers_best_effort` (`core/engine/tests.rs`), and `kill_running_turn_foreground_scopes_to_this_turns_unowned_foreground_shells` (`tools/shell/tests.rs`); fingerprints are the T1/T2 steer entries in `scripts/fork-guard.sh`.
- **Upstream policy**: the capability is implemented upstream-neutrally (English comments, no Pinvou-private context) and should later be contributed from a clean branch off upstream main per the standing rules; this register is authoritative until that lands.

## Topics

PR #13 was squash-merged as `a36e6cd533024cfe5724bae21875aea42b2ed87a` and published as immutable tag `pinvou-v0.9.5-r7`. It removes product-specific orchestration while preserving canonical registry prompt text and alias-aware Custom SubAgent allowlist resolution.

1. **Host embedding and routing boundary** — the established T1 commits through `feb8761aeda31749f3d54c6e1f8ef460540567a1` (`#19`), plus `485884913308cdf7564bc60da2e416be637083b5` (`#21`), `04e109af4b4786a0d49fbbeefdd77af15a9f495e` (`#22`), `69ed3bfbdb314f901d4cf4120f1caaaf0b6aa529` (`#30`), and `0d89a31be016457c180501417dd2c0f34ce844a6` (`#18`). Exposes narrow host seams for routing, runtime snapshots/recovery, reliable steer ownership and withdrawal, edit-target classification, provider compatibility, and post-compaction usage estimation. Explicit route ceilings constrain request budgets; strict-direct casing recovery requires one unambiguous owned model row. Edit rejection cannot call the provider or mutate history, and gateways plus ambiguous models remain untouched.
2. **Tool compatibility and command-execution safety** — the established T2 commits through the Shell-cancellation boundary in `8aa5f77d35ac1d00d1f444193543307a7e9b391c` (`#16`), plus `44730dfe596b70f86ae2f928959877a3e3f494e4` (`#27`), `665b46cd9e67326459223aa662931bd36d726004` (`#29`), `04e109af4b4786a0d49fbbeefdd77af15a9f495e` (`#22`), `4831c3797b76485a912b056c76a4cff22f0a2863` (`#25`), `e68a185c2ba07f327bd8b63bbfea6a70a96f33ea` (`#26`), the six `#33` commits `ecfd68acc056b95b06d98312753a712e4c0755db`, `603eeadcdab65d71d62a5ac32b6700207433fe5c`, `eb25a255a92f7385a3fde74f1f44626cdd068125`, `8c243e7ea7094fff189ab12582aea0460b655d06`, `8111f8150bc6b103da685f6abc3f26143b3bb207`, and `4f612e548090616f8206154e37c9895404a8998b`, `9c5f4f19b0acbc960889778a5873c7fb038b1378` (`#35`), and `f853f8f1566c57e6be40d5439a222a932aa79ef5` (`#32`). Adds exact catalog/final-dispatch policy, read-only projections, per-tool Moonshot schema degradation with a visible diagnostic, process-local MCP secret resolution, pool-side denied-server sealing, incremental Windows Shell decoding, provider-native search adapters with exact fail-closed endpoint gating (`#33`), the keyless Bing chain tail after API-backed providers (`#35`), and default-off GAIA benchmark controls (`#32`). These generic seams remain prioritized for upstreaming; Pinvou's GAIA profiles stay app-owned.
3. **Embedded context and Skill sources** — `5a9f52941b83452c1e8b76c2d679bac315edcf70`. Seals ambient project authority, scans only the explicit Skill root, filters disabled Skills, preserves up to 100 KiB only for the Permissions fragment, and excludes internal reminders from Working Set extraction.
4. **Automation and runtime lifecycle** — `fc84f7d3e5dca0e3db404d43e218597764129f9b`. Preserves stable conversation/thread identity, v4 task compatibility, anchored schedules, no-backfill/no-overlap behavior, and terminal-only cleanup.

Pinvou's product tool allowlist, connector state, UI, workspace selection, bundle instructions, session Skill materialization, and presentation remain in `pinvou3-app`.

## v0.9.5 migration notes

- The parent passes through the new `EngineConfig.subagent_state_root` field.
- The removed legacy `hidden_tools` field is not restored; session-level hiding already uses dynamic `disallowed_tools` shaping.
- The upstream 40 KiB WorldState cap is retained globally. Only `FragmentId::Permissions` uses the existing 100 KiB instruction limit.
- The parent lockfile reflects the v0.9.5 workspace-crate split without adding a new direct Pinvou dependency.

## Verification

- CodeWhale format and locked library check pass.
- All 63 CodeWhale `forkguard_*` tests pass for the r13 baseline, including the r12 search regressions and six feature-gated GAIA benchmark-isolation tests added in r13.
- Parent `./scripts/fork-guard.sh` passes with the app forkguard suite, including the strict-direct GLM casing bridge regression; both admitted-display edit-target regressions pass separately.
- The Tauri/Web scheduled-task unit harness, architecture guard, version check, CI-policy tests, and strict public-submodule verifier pass.
- Full product results are recorded in `docs/codewhale-upgrade-0.9.0-to-0.9.5.md`.

Any fork-distinct change must update this register, guard fingerprints, and a result-oriented behavior test, then pass `./scripts/fork-guard.sh --fast`.
